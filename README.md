AI Endoscopy App  

Title: AI Endoscopy Assistant  

Smart Video Analysis & Automated Patient Reporting System 

Developer: Tayyab Khan 

1. Overview (Project Introduction) AI Endoscopy Assistant is a mobile application designed to help Doctors (Gastroenterologists) and Patients. The main purpose of this app is to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically detect abnormalities in endoscopy videos. 

This project was built as my Final Year Project (FYP). The main focus was to create a strong backend system where medical reports are generated by AI and automatically sent to the patient's dashboard without any manual work. 

2. Key Features (What the App Does) 

Doctor’s Portal: Doctors can securely upload endoscopy videos for analysis. 

AI Detection: The app uses a custom AI model to scan the video frame-by-frame and find any diseases. 

Smart Patient Search: 

Doctors can search for patients by Name or Email. 

Duplicate Name Handling: If 10 patients have the same name (e.g., "Ali"), the app shows a list with unique details so the doctor can select the correct patient. 

Auto-Dispatch System: As soon as the AI generates the text report, the app automatically sends it to the selected patient’s account. The doctor does not need to email it manually. 

3. How It Works (The Workflow) 

Upload: The Doctor logs in and uploads the video. 

Select Patient: The Doctor searches and selects the specific patient from the database. 

Process: The video is sent to the AI Model. 

Report: The AI detects issues and writes a text report. 

View: The report instantly appears on the Patient’s screen. 

4. Tech Stack (Tools Used) 

Frontend (App): Flutter (for Android/iOS) 

Backend: Firebase Ecosystem (Authentication & Storage) 

Database: Cloud Firestore (Real-time database) 

AI Model: Python (Custom Deep Learning Model) 

Connectivity: Ngrok (Used to connect the local Python AI server to the mobile app for free). 

5. Developer Note This app is a prototype. My main goal was to perfect the AI integration and the Database Logic (like handling duplicate names and auto-sharing). The UI is kept simple to focus on functionality.
